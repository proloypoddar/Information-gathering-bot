This code is creating a bot in Python that uses the Facebook Graph API to extract information about upcoming events posted on Facebook pages and Facebook events. It takes a list of Facebook page and event URLs as input, and then extracts information about their upcoming events, including the event name, start time, and location.

The bot then saves this information to an Excel spreadsheet, which can be useful for keeping track of upcoming events and for analyzing event data. The code uses the openpyxl library to create and write data to the Excel file.

Overall, this bot can save time and effort for individuals or organizations who want to stay updated on upcoming events posted on multiple Facebook pages or events.
